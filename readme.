zoo-breeding-service v.1 is now too big of a mess for me to try to salvage.
Even deleting the project and re cloning the repo, it retains changes to the
development environment that I do not know how to fix, the results of trying
to get the postgres database and alembic working properly.

For now, I am starting fresh with v.2 of the project, with the intent to get all
features working properly before attempting to implement the database and alembic.
This seems to be working so far.


CURRENTLY PLANNED FEATURES:

1. Breeding Management
Pair Matching and Compatibility: Match breeding pairs based on genetic diversity, age, and health status to promote healthy offspring.
Breeding History Tracking: Maintain a history of breeding events for each animal, including dates and outcomes.
Success Rate Analysis: Track breeding success rates to identify patterns and improve outcomes.
2. Litter and Offspring Management
Litter Tracking: Record detailed information about litters, including size, birth date, and descriptions.
Offspring Monitoring: Track the health, growth, and milestones of individual offspring.
Mortality and Survival Rates: Log offspring survival rates to help improve breeding practices.
3. Health and Veterinary Management
Health Check Scheduling: Automatically schedule health checks for breeding pairs and newborns.
Vaccination and Medical Records: Maintain detailed medical records for all animals, including vaccinations and treatments.
Incident Reporting: Log incidents such as illness, injury, or premature death.
4. Environmental and Behavioral Data
Breeding Environment Monitoring: Record environmental conditions during breeding events, such as temperature, humidity, and enclosure type.
Behavioral Observations: Log animal behavior during courtship, mating, and after birth to identify potential issues.
5. Reporting and Analytics
Breeding Reports: Generate detailed reports on breeding events, outcomes, and trends over time.
Genetic Diversity Reports: Analyze the genetic diversity of the zooâ€™s population to prevent inbreeding.
Performance Dashboards: Provide visual dashboards with key metrics, such as breeding success rates, offspring survival rates, and health statistics.
6. Notifications and Alerts
Breeding Alerts: Notify staff of upcoming breeding events or overdue breedings.
Health Alerts: Notify veterinarians of animals requiring urgent health checks or treatments.
Milestone Alerts: Send reminders for important milestones, such as weaning or vaccinations.
7. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
User Roles: Provide different access levels for administrators, veterinarians, caretakers, and researchers.
Data Security: Ensure sensitive data, such as genetic profiles, is only accessible to authorized personnel.
8. Data Export and Backup
Export to CSV/Excel: Allow users to export breeding and health data for offline analysis.
Automated Backups: Ensure regular data backups to prevent loss.
